# SBEMimage

Open-source acquisition software for scanning electron microscopy with a focus on serial block-face imaging.

*SBEMimage* is designed for complex, challenging acquisition tasks, such as large-scale volume imaging of neuronal tissue or other biological ultrastructure. Advanced monitoring, process control, and error handling capabilities improve reliability, speed, and quality of acquisitions. Debris detection, autofocus, real-time image inspection, and various other quality control features minimize the risk of data loss. Adaptive tile selection allows for efficient imaging of large volumes of arbitrary shape. The software’s graphical user interface is optimized for remote operation. It includes a user-friendly Viewport to visually set up acquisitions and monitor them.

*SBEMimage* is customizable and extensible, which allows for fast prototyping and permits adaptation to a wide range of SEM/SBEM systems, auxiliary devices and applications.

## Getting started / Support

Please read the user guide: https://sbemimage.readthedocs.io. It currently contains installation instructions, a short introduction to the software (to be expanded) and information for developers. For users who are not familiar with Python, it is recommended to download the Windows 7/10 installer. For support and discussion, please use the [Image.sc forum](https://forum.image.sc/) and post to the forum with the tag 'sbemimage'.

## Development

The development of *SBEMimage* at the Friedrich Miescher Institute in Basel has been supported by the Novartis Research Foundation and by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (Grant Agreement No. 742576). Other institutes that have substantially contributed to *SBEMimage* development/testing: EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland (CIME/BioEM); Francis Crick Institute, London, UK.
